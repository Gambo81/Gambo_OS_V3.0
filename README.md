If you are not using the disk then make sure to add a file for programs, paint, and a notepad directory in the user directory.

To change the usermane and password use this command: edit /startup/startup.lua. There are two variables on line 10 and 11. Chane the parts that say localadmin.

The passwords for over programs can be changed fron these files: uninstallpassword, commandlinepassword, and fileexplorerpassword.

To change the password for 'uninstallpassword' run theis command: edit /os/uninstallpassword.lua

To change the password for 'commandlinepassword' run theis command: edit /os/utils/commandlinepassword.lua

To change the password for 'fileexplorerpassword' run theis command: edit /os/utils/fileexplorerpassword.lua

Thank you for using my OS.
